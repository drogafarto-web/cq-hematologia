## Baseline Timeline (Green Path)

| Phase              | Start      | End        | Duration | Key Milestones                            | Owner         | Status    |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| **Phase 4**        | 2026-05-20 | 2026-06-02 | 14 days  | Portal auth + NOTIVISA sandbox live       | Executor      | PLANNED   |
| **Phase 5**        | 2026-06-09 | 2026-07-07 | 29 days  | Critical values + Twilio SMS escalation   | Executor      | PLANNED   |
| **Phase 6**        | 2026-07-14 | 2026-08-04 | 22 days  | Bioquímica Phase 2 (analytes + OCR)       | Executor      | PLANNED   |
| **Phase 7**        | 2026-08-04 | 2026-08-18 | 15 days  | Patient portal Phase 2 (complaints + NPS) | Executor      | PLANNED   |
| **Phase 8**        | 2026-08-18 | 2026-08-31 | 14 days  | CAPA closure + micro-modules + ceremony   | Executor      | PLANNED   |
| **CAPA Ceremony**  | 2026-08-05 | 2026-08-05 | 1 day    | Auditor sign-off on closure items         | CTO + Auditor | SCHEDULED |
| **External Audit** | 2026-08-31 | 2026-09-30 | 30 days  | DICQ 85%+ verification (target)           | Auditor       | PLANNED   |
| **Audit Sign-Off** | 2026-10-31 | 2026-10-31 | —        | DICQ compliance certified                 | Auditor       | PLANNED   |

**Critical Path:**

```
Phase 4 (Portal) → Phase 5 (Critical Values) → Phase 6 (Bioquímica)
→ Phase 7 (Portal Phase 2) → Phase 8 (CAPA) → External Audit
```

**Dependency Chain:**

- Phase 4 unblocks Phase 5 (NOTIVISA API tested in sandbox)
- Phase 5 unblocks Phase 6 (SMS escalation infrastructure ready)
- Phase 8 blocked until Phase 7 complete (all modules must be in place for CAPA assessment)
- External Audit begins only after Phase 8 ceremony completed

## Contingency Scenarios

### Scenario A: Auditor Alignment Delayed (RFI Loop Extended)

**Trigger:** Auditor requests major clarifications on ADR-0022, ADR-0024, or ADR-0026 during alignment call (May 13–17). RFI response cycle extends to May 27.

**Impact on Timeline:**

| Item                        | Baseline  | Scenario A | Delta       |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Auditor call                | May 13–17 | May 13–17  | —           |
| RFI response                | May 19    | May 27     | +8 days     |
| Phase 4 kickoff             | May 20    | May 28     | +8 days     |
| Phase 4 deploy              | Jun 2     | Jun 10     | +8 days     |
| Phase 5 start               | Jun 9     | Jun 17     | +8 days     |
| Phase 5 deploy              | Jul 7     | Jul 15     | +8 days     |
| **Critical:** CAPA Ceremony | Aug 5     | Aug 13     | **+8 days** |
| External Audit start        | Aug 31    | Sep 8      | +8 days     |
| Audit sign-off deadline     | Oct 31    | Nov 8      | **+8 days** |

**Recovery Path:**

1. **Immediate (May 20):** Spike task: "Auditor RFI deep-dive — clarify threat model + NOTIVISA webhook idempotency + portal email token rotation every 72h (ADR-0024 §3.2)."
   - Owner: CTO + compliance SME
   - Duration: 3 days (May 20–22)
   - Output: 5-page RFI response with threat matrix re-validation + test case addendum

2. **May 23–27:** Async RFI loop — expect auditor turnaround ~24–48h per round. Prepare fallback answers for 3 common pushbacks:
   - _"How do you prevent email replay attacks on portal link?"_ → Answer: 7-day `exp` claim + HMAC re-validation on click + IP geo-lock optional (ADR-0024 §2.1)
   - _"What happens if NOTIVISA webhook fails after async append?"_ → Answer: Retry queue with exponential backoff; manual reconciliation via Cloud Scheduler job (ADR-0026 §4.2)
   - _"Does patient consent for portal login fall under LGPD §9 or §18?"_ → Answer: Both (initial consent + persistent audit trail per §38 mandate)

3. **May 28 (Phase 4 kickoff):** Start Phase 4 **in parallel** while awaiting final auditor sign-off.
   - Risk: Slight chance of rework if auditor requests architectural change (low probability if RFI resolved well).
   - Mitigation: Code all Phase 4 tasks in feature branches; do NOT merge to `main` until auditor confirms.

4. **Aug 13 (CAPA Ceremony adjusted):** Auditor signs off on closure items with Aug 13 date. No functional impact — only calendar shift.

**Probability:** 30% (auditor typically has 1–2 rounds of questions on new state machines).

---

### Scenario B: Vendor Integration Slips (NOTIVISA Sandbox or Twilio Onboarding Delayed)

**Trigger:** NOTIVISA provisioning takes 10 days instead of 5 (government sandbox delays) OR Twilio SMS provisioning blocked by compliance docs (Brazilian regulatory review required).

**Impact on Timeline:**

| Item                        | Baseline     | Scenario B    | Delta       |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| Vendor credentials ready    | May 15       | May 25        | +10 days    |
| Phase 4 sandbox testing     | May 20–Jun 2 | May 30–Jun 10 | +10 days    |
| Phase 4 deploy              | Jun 2        | Jun 10        | +8 days     |
| Phase 5 (Twilio live)       | Jun 9–Jul 7  | Jun 17–Jul 15 | +8 days     |
| **Critical:** Phase 6 start | Jul 14       | Jul 22        | **+8 days** |
| Phase 8 (all modules ready) | Aug 18–31    | Aug 26–Sep 8  | **+8 days** |
| External Audit start        | Aug 31       | Sep 8         | +8 days     |
| Audit sign-off deadline     | Oct 31       | Nov 8         | **+8 days** |

**Recovery Path:**

1. **Immediate (May 7–8):** Pre-flight vendor coordination:
   - Send **formal onboarding request** to NOTIVISA + Twilio TODAY (not May 15).
   - Ask: "(A) What is your SLA for sandbox provisioning? (B) Do you require compliance docs? (C) What is your escalation contact?"
   - Document responses in `EMAIL_TEMPLATES_VENDOR_COORDINATION.md` with timestamps.

2. **May 15–20:** If vendors are slow:
   - **Build Phase 4 in mock mode:** Implement NOTIVISA client with stubbed API (`/sandbox/notivisa-mock.ts`).
   - All business logic tested against mock; swap real API on credential arrival.
   - Prevents Phase 4 from blocking Phase 5.
   - Risk: Minimal (mock follows same interface as real API per ADR-0026 §3.1).

3. **Phase 5 Parallel Track (if Twilio is delayed only):**
   - If NOTIVISA is ready but Twilio is not:
     - Start Phase 5 backend (state machine + Cloud Function wiring) WITHOUT SMS provider.
     - SMS template ready; deploy phase gate: "Twilio credentials in Cloud Secret Manager" (manual gate at May 26).
     - Phase 5 deploy moves to Jun 10, but doesn't block Phase 6 if Phase 6 doesn't depend on SMS.
     - Confirm dependency: Phase 6 (Bioquímica) has **zero** SMS dependency. ✅ Clear to proceed.

4. **Fallback: Extend Phase 4 duration** (accept slip):
   - If both vendors are 10+ days late:
     - Phase 4 ends Jun 10 instead of Jun 2 (8-day buffer accepted).
     - Phase 5 starts Jun 17 instead of Jun 9 (acceptable — no calendar conflict).
     - All downstream phases shift by 8 days, but **do NOT move CAPA Ceremony date** (Aug 5 is hard constraint).
     - Action: Cut 1 Phase 8 micro-module if needed to keep Aug 5 ceremony on track.

5. **Escalation path (if >10 days delay):**
   - Notify CTO by May 25.
   - CTO escalates directly to vendor C-level (NOTIVISA = gov contact, Twilio = account rep).
   - Alternative: Use Twilio trial SMS (no Brazilian number pool, but unblocks dev).
   - Alternative: Pause Phase 5 SMS feature; go live with Portal + NOTIVISA only.

**Probability:** 40% (vendor delays common in Brazil for gov APIs; Twilio's Brazil compliance review typically 7–10 days).

---

### Scenario C: Go/No-Go Gate Failure (May 19 Pre-Phase-4 Blocker)

**Trigger:** One or more pre-Phase-4 prerequisites fail:

- Auditor alignment call incomplete or conditional approval only
- Cloud Monitoring dashboards not deployed (alerting infrastructure down)
- Test environment Firestore not seeded (staging unavailable)
- Resource allocation template unfilled (no team assigned to Phase 4)
- On-call rotation not distributed (incident response untested)

**Impact on Timeline:**

| Item                 | Baseline  | Scenario C     | Recovery           |
| -------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Phase 4 kickoff gate | May 20    | **BLOCKED**    | +1 to +7 days      |
| Phase 4 deploy       | Jun 2     | Jun 9–16       | +7 to +14 days     |
| Downstream phases    | All shift | Cascading slip | See recovery below |

**Go/No-Go Gate Checklist (by May 19 EOD):**

```
☐ Auditor alignment call completed (RFI feedback documented)
☐ Auditor verbal approval: "OK to proceed with Phase 4 as designed"
☐ NOTIVISA sandbox API call successful (HTTP 200 on test request)
☐ Twilio account provisioned (SMS numbers assigned + test SMS sent)
☐ Cloud Monitoring dashboards live (System Health + SLO Tracking visible in Console)
☐ Cloud Monitoring alert policy armed (test alert received via email/Slack)
☐ Resource allocation template filled (team names, FTE-weeks, skill gaps)
☐ Staging Firestore seeded (test data loaded, Cloud Functions deployed)
☐ On-call rotation calendar distributed (Slack #on-call-paging created + members added)
☐ Executor hand-off meeting completed (Phase 4 Plans 01–03 reviewed, blockers identified)
```

**Recovery Path (Tiered by Blocker Type):**

#### **Type 1: Auditor/Compliance (Critical)**

If auditor approval is conditional (not full go):

- **Action:** Schedule emergency 30-min call for May 19.
- **Owner:** CTO + auditor.
- **Outcome:** Either (A) Full approval → proceed, or (B) Conditional (specific ADR revision required) → slip to May 27.
- **Contingency:** If no resolution by May 19 noon, halt Phase 4 kickoff until May 27 (7-day slip acceptable per Scenario A).

#### **Type 2: Vendor/Infrastructure (Medium)**

If NOTIVISA or Twilio not ready:

- **Action:** Activate Scenario B mock-mode path (Phase 4 proceeds with stubbed API).
- **Timeline impact:** 0 days (Phase 4 still starts May 20, but deploy may slip to Jun 10).
- **Outcome:** Phase 4 design complete + tested against mock; real API swap when credentials arrive.

If Cloud Monitoring or Staging Firestore not ready:

- **Action:** Fast-track setup (2-day sprint May 19–20).
  - Monitoring: `scripts/setup-cloud-monitoring.sh` + 30 min manual dashboard review.
  - Staging: Run `v1.4-TEST_DATA_STRATEGY.md` seed scripts (idempotent, 45 min total).
- **Timeline impact:** 0 days (setup completes before Phase 4 starts).
- **Escalation:** If not ready by EOD May 20, Phase 4 continues with production-only monitoring (not ideal, but acceptable for 1 week).

#### **Type 3: Planning/Process (Low)**

If resource allocation unfilled or on-call not distributed:

- **Action:** CTO completes these async on May 19 (these are **not** technical blockers).
- **Timeline impact:** 0 days (process tasks, not code).
- **Outcome:** Hand-off meeting moves to May 21 if needed (1-day slip acceptable).

#### **Consolidated Recovery (Multiple Blockers):**

| Blocker              | Recovery time | Acceptable?      | Fallback                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auditor conditional  | 7 days        | YES (Scenario A) | Proceed with conditional, rework if needed                     |
| Vendor not ready     | 10 days       | YES (Scenario B) | Use mock API, swap real at delivery                            |
| Monitoring not ready | 2 days        | YES              | Expedite setup, use temporary logging if needed                |
| Staging not ready    | 2 days        | YES              | Seed Friday May 19, ready Monday May 20                        |
| Team not assigned    | 1 day         | YES              | CTO assigns, hand-off Tuesday May 21                           |
| **Any 2+ blockers**  | **May 27**    | **CONDITIONAL**  | Skip Phases 4–5, start Phase 6 in parallel (requires approval) |

**Decision Tree (May 19 EOD):**

```
┌─ All 10 checks ✓
│  └─→ APPROVED: Phase 4 kickoff May 20 (GREEN)
│
├─ 1–2 checks ✗ (Vendor/Infra/Process)
│  └─→ APPROVED with remediation: Phase 4 starts May 20, mock mode or fast-track setup
│       → YELLOW
│
├─ 3+ checks ✗ OR Auditor condition not resolved
│  └─→ BLOCKED: Delay Phase 4 to May 27 (RFI/vendor/setup completion)
│       → RED
│
└─ Auditor or Critical path ✗ (can't be mocked)
   └─→ BLOCKED: Escalate to CTO, assess Phase structure change
        (e.g., start Phase 6 while waiting for Phase 4 prerequisites)
        → BLACK (emergency decision)
```

**Probability:** 25% (typical for startup projects; often 1–2 minor blockers, rarely critical path failures).

---

## Escalation & Decision Authority

### Scenario A (Auditor Delay)

- **Authority:** CTO (approval of 8-day slip acceptable, within margin).
- **Escalation:** If RFI round 2 needed, notify executive sponsor (VP Engineering or CEO) by May 25.
- **Decision:** Proceed with Phase 4 in parallel (feature branches, no main merge until approval).

### Scenario B (Vendor Delay)

- **Authority:** Executor (can activate mock API path without CTO approval).
- **Escalation:** If delay >10 days, CTO escalates to vendors' C-level; notify executive sponsor by May 22.
- **Decision:** Accept 8-day Phase 4 deploy slip if needed; do NOT extend Phase 8 beyond Aug 31 (CAPA Ceremony hard date).

### Scenario C (Pre-Phase4 Gate Failure)

- **Authority:** CTO (full decision on go/no-go).
- **Yellow → Proceed:** Auditor + 1 minor blocker → approved with remediation plan.
- **Red → 7-day delay:** 2+ blockers or Auditor conditional → Phase 4 moves to May 27; all phases shift by 7 days.
- **Black → Escalate:** 3+ blockers or critical path failure → emergency decision on Phase structure (e.g., parallel Phase 6 start).
